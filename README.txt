TOM'S EXPRESSION TREE CONSTRUCTOR AND EVALUATOR

For this program to run, you must first install python 3.6 which can be found at 
python.org/downloads/release/python-360/

To run this program:
1) open your terminal to the directory where exptree.py was installed.
2) enter the following command: 
	'python3 exptree.py'
3) follow the prompt, it should say 'enter an infix expression delimited by spaces (integers only):'.

An infix expression delimited by spaces is an arithmetic expression where each operator 
or operand is seperated by spaces. For example:
	5 + 3 - 1
is valid (and it evaluates to 7), however
	5+3-1
is invalid. If you have entered something incorrectly, the program will terminal with an error message.
